# Swiss-Army-Program
This Program is a tool built in Microsoft Macro Assembler code that has multiple mini programs. 


The main.asm file is where all the code is written. To run the program, you will need to download all the files open them in [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/). You will also need to download the Irvine library with the [Getting Started with MASM and Visual Studio 2022](http://www.asmirvine.com/gettingStartedVS2022/index.htm) tutorial. If you prefer a video explanation, you can watch the following [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyoYNFO9XM). (Please note the YouTube tutorial is for the 2019 version, but the steps are relatively the same. Reference the Getting Started with MASM and Visual Studio 2022 for the steps that maybe different.)


Once that is downloaded and completed you will need to do the following operations:

select project.sln -> main.asm
